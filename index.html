      <p>Franz Kafka was a German-speaking Bohemian writer who is widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. He was born on July 3, 1883, in Prague, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and died on June 3, 1924, in Kierling, Austria, of tuberculosis.</p>
      <p>Kafka's works, which include novels, short stories, and letters, explore themes of alienation, guilt, and absurdity. Some of his most famous works include <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, <em>The Trial</em>, and <em>The Castle</em>.</p>
      <p>Kafka's literary style is characterized by its clarity and precision, as well as its use of surreal and fantastic elements. His writing has had a profound influence on modern literature and continues to be studied and celebrated today.</p>
      <blockquote>"I am a cage, in search of a bird."</blockquote>
      <p>Throughout his life, Kafka struggled with depression and anxiety, which is reflected in his writing. Despite this, he remained dedicated to his craft and continued to write until his death at the age of 40.</p>
